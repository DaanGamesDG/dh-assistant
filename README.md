> The open-source multi-purpose Discord bot for Draavo's Hangout

## Information

Please read this if you are thinking of hosting this bot yourself. This project is open-sourced because I do not earn money with it. You are allowed to host it yourself, but do not show in any way that this bot is created by you. I didn't use complicated licenses because I don't want to go through all that copyright shit, I only need you guys to leave the credits where they are, that's all. Very simple.

## Install
