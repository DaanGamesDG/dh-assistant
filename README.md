The open-source multi-purpose Discord bot for Draavo's Hangout

## Information

Please read this if you are thinking of hosting this bot yourself. This project is open-sourced because I do not earn money with it. **You are allowed to host it yourself, but do not show in any way that this bot is created by you**. I didn't use complicated licenses because I don't want to go through all that copyright shit, I only need you guys to **leave the credits where they are**, that's all. Very simple.

I made this bot as customisable as possible, every setting can be found in the config folder. Some settings are hard coded and shouldn't be changed unless you know what you are doing.

This bot is designed to work with Draavo's Hangout, even though this is a customisable bot, **some features may not work as expected on other servers**. [The dashboard](https://daangamesdg.wtf/github/dh-dashboard) is part of this bot, it is **optional** but will improve functionality and the overall experience.

**DO NOT INSTALL OLDER VERSIONS**, please check [the security policy](/SECURITY.md) for all the supported versions. If you still want to use an older version, use it at your own risk. **I am in no way responsible for any damage done to the bot, you or your pc/hardware used to run the bot**. I will also not provide any support for deprecated versions.
